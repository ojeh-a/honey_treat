        I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from web development to mobile app development. I have experience working with a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
