    <p>
        I am a software developer with a passion for creating and building things. I have a background in computer science and have worked on a variety of projects ranging from web development to mobile app development. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

        My name is Ojeh Agbaje; I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I'm mostly driven by curiosity to know how things really work, and I try to look for ways to make things better. There are very few things I really understand, so I ask a lot of questions and im always willing to learn. I am a team player and I believe that the best way to learn is to learn from others. I hope to be able to help as many people as possible with my skills, but I have to help myself first lol. I good music, the game of chess fascinates me eventhough I barely know how to play, basketball is my goto sports but like everything I do, I barely know how to play the game.....this is looking like a dating bio already lol, checkout my skillsets below if you have job for me and I promise I will be better at that than I am at chess and basketball. I am a work in progress, so please be patient with me. Thank you for visiting my page and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask, my social media links are below.
